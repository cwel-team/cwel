## Intro

CWEL's CSS can seen as Countrywide's equivalent of Bootstrap, inasmuch as when used with the correct HTML markup and JS it will provide instantly gratifying results. CWEL uses SCSS as a preprocessing language for the framework's CSS.

CWEL's SCSS can be broken down into 2 key areas:

1. Core
2. Components

'Core' consists of:

- Global settings
- Global mixins
- CSS normalization (reset)
- Typography

'Components' consists of all components within the CWEL library.

'Core' can be used as an independent resource, whereas 'Components' rely on 'Core' so cannot be used alone.

## Source Folder Structure

```
+---- components/      [folder] All CWEL components (including non-standard components such as 'reset' and 'typography')
|
+---- functions/       [folder] SCSS functions - function file names are prefixed with 'fn-'
|
+---- mixins/          [folder] SCSS mixins - mixin file names are prefixed with 'mxn-'
|
+---- variables/       [folder] SCSS variables - variable file names are prefixed with 'vbl-'
|
+ core.scss            [file] SCSS file that provides the bare minimum required to get CWEL up and running
|
+ main.scss            [file] SCSS file that includes 'core.scss' and all CWEL components in one big bundle
```

## Compilation

The build process takes care of compilation into CSS and places the rendered files in following places:

- `\Cwel\dist\Cwel\cwel.css`
- Some other file

## Product Usage

### In-House

When building a new product, it's within the team's interest to serve a compiled CSS file containing only the components used. CWEL will be accessible as an installed NuGet package, from where the various source files can be obtained. With that in mind, the product's `main.scss` file may look like this:

``` scss
// Cwel core files
@@import '../../Cwel/Core/scss/core';

// Product-specific core files
@@import 'Core/reset';
@@import 'Branding/color';
@@import 'Branding/typography';

// Cwel components used in this project
@@import '../../Cwel/Component/Card/Card';

// Product-specific component branding (theming)
@@import 'Component/Card/Card';

// Cwel patterns used in this project
@@import '../../Cwel/Pattern/CardSlider/CardSlider';

// Product-specific pattern branding (theming)
@@import 'Pattern/CardSlider/CardSlider';
```

`../../Cwel` denotes that a file is being used from within the CWEL NuGet package. All other files are specific to that product. It may turn out that the default CWEL theming is sufficient, so product theming may not be necessary.

### Third Party

Third parties will be supplied the source SCSS files, but be encouraged to use the compiled `main.css` file, containing the entirity of CWEL.
