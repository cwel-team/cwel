# Create something

This document provides instructions on how to create something, something that
ends up as part of the CWEL library's source code for everyone to use in their
projects.

For starters we're going to cover where source code is kept, then the creation
of a component as these are what CWEL is all about. Afterwards we will
cover how to develop something that isn't a component. Both share a core
workflow with slight differences.


## Components

Instructions on how to build a component can be found at the
[create component readme](create-component-readme).


## Services

Instructions on how to build a service can be found at the
[create service readme](create-service-readme).


## Miscellaneous SCSS

Other, non-component related styles for CWEL are located in the `~/cwel/style`
directory: e.g. the [CWEL grid](grid-docs). To read up on how these files are
organized, read the readme on [scss file organization](scss-organization).


## Miscellaneous JavaScript

Other, non-component or service related JavaScript for CWEL is located in the
`~/cwel/script` directory: e.g. angular directives for animations or other
stuff. To read up on how these files are organized, read the readme on
[js file organization](js-organization).
