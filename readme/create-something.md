## Library source code

All source code for the library can be found in the `~/cwel` directory.

### Components
Each component has all its required files located under
`~/cwel/component/{componentName}`. This includes `.es`, `.scss`, and `.html`
files.

### Other
Other, non-component related styles for CWEL are located in the `~/cwel/style`
directory: e.g. the [CWEL grid](grid-docs). To read up on how these files are
organized, read the [readme on scss file organization](scss-organization).
