# Cwel

Welcome to CWEL, a front-end framework and experience language for the web.

## Setup Instructions

Setup involves a set of gulp commands:

- Active development: `gulp watch` to get the sandbox and documentation page up.
- Build: `gulp build` to build the entire project.
- Test
	- unit (karma): `gulp test-unit`
	- end to end (protractor): `gulp test-e2e`
	- visual (galen): `gulp test-visual`

## SCSS File Organization

To read up on how the SCSS files are organized for CWEL, read the
[readme on scss file organization](./readme/SCSS-organization.md).

## Sandbox Pages

To work on the CWEL library or experiment with new ideas, sandbox pages
can be made. To do so, follow the steps outlined in the [sandbox readme](./readme/Sandbox.md).

## Documenation Site

To document new components, patterns, or any piece of CWEL, documentation pages
can be generated. Gulp tasks are used to generate them, of which the inner
workings are explained in the [readme for documentation pages](./readme/Docs-site.md).

## To Do

For a list of miscellaneous ToDo tasks, see the [todo readme](./readme/Todo.md).
