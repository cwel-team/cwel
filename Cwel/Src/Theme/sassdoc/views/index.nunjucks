 # So: `groups > types > items`.

 # Groups usually have quite unfriendly names, hence `undefined`. Fortunately, they can be aliased
 # from the configuration file of the theme. Then, SassDoc processes it to generate a `groups` object.
 # In this object, each group name is mapped to either an alias if specified in the configuration file
 # or the same group name. For instance:
 #
    groups = {
        'undefined': 'My Awesome Default Group',
    }
 #
 # To retrieve the alias of a group, use `groups[group_name]`. In this case, `groups['undefined']` will
 # return `My Awesome Default Group`.
 #}

 # To display our items, we need to:
 # 1. Loop over `data.byGroupAndType` groups
 # 2. Loop over types mapped to each group
 # 3. Loop over items mapped to each type
