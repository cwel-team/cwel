## Technology Used

We use [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com/gulp/) to generate all dynamic SCSS documentation. This is a mature and very capable product that does everything that we need it to (and much more) so felt no need to write our own. We use it as part of the `cwel-docs-generate-dynamic-scss-docs`.
